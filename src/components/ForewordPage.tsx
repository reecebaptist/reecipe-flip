            Cooking is one of the simplest ways to turn time into care. It slows
            us down long enough to notice ingredients, to listen for the quiet
            cues of heat, and to share something nourishing with the people
            around us.
          </p>

            A good cookbook is more than a list of recipes—it’s a map. It points
            to reliable techniques, offers substitutions when life gets messy,
            and teaches a rhythm you can return to on weeknights or weekends
            alike.
          </p>

            In these pages, you’ll find approachable methods framed by clear
            steps and sensible ratios. Treat them as starting points. Taste
            often, season with intention, and let your preferences shape the
            final result.
          </p>

            Don’t worry about perfection. Browning will sometimes go further
            than planned, doughs will be stickier than expected, and pans won’t
            always be the right size. Those moments are part of the craft—and
            often where you learn the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of all, enjoy the process. Put on music, breathe in the
            aromatics, and serve with confidence. May this cookbook make your
            kitchen feel a little more welcoming and your table a little more
            full.
